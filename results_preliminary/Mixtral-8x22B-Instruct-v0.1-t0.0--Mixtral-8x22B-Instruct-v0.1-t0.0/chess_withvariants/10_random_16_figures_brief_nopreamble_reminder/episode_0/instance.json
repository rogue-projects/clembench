You are playing a variant of chess where each player plays with 16randomised pieces. Our initial board is: \n\nq q k r b q p p\nb r b r b b n r\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\nB P B R Q N B Q\nK R R P R N N B\n\nAll the pieces move like in a normal game. \n\nCastling and en-passant are not allowed and like in a normal chess game the loss condition is receiving a checkmate or stalemate. If you break the rules of moving in chess you lose as well.\n\nMoves have to be written in the UCI format (\"b5b4\" where the figure in b5 should be moved to position b4). \nYou have to write ONLY the next move, do not add any explanation or commentary to your moves.\nYour objective is to win, or failing this, to draw.\n\n"}
