If you break the rules of moving in chess you lose as well.\n\nMoves have to be written in the UCI format (\"b5b4\" where the figure in b5 should be moved to position b4). \nYou have to write ONLY the next move, do not add any explanation or commentary to your moves.\nYour objective is to win, or failing this, to draw.\n\n\n You're playing white."}}], [{"from": "w", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-31T21:52:02.573872", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "e2e4"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-31T21:52:02.577835", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "\"e2e4\" violates movement rules"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "w", "timestamp": "2024-07-31T21:52:02.578159", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Your previous move was an illegal move that does not conform to how the figure in position \"e2\" moves.
