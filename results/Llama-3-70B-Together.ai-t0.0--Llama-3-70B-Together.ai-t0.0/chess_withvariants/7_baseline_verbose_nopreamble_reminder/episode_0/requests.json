We represent coordinates on this board in two axes, represented by numbers 1-8 and letters a-g, with origin a1 being the bottom left corner. The axis running a-g is the horizontal axis in the above board, and 1-8 the vertical. The capital characters represent the white player’s pieces, situated along the bottom (along the rows a1-g1 and a2-g2) while the lower case characters represent black’s pieces situated along the top (the rows a8-g8 a7-g7). Each turn a piece may be moved, represented by a coordinate change string such as a2a3 (for a piece moving from the square a2 to the square a3), g1f3, c5d6, etc. . If the piece is moved to a square occupied by the opposing colour (player), it will capture that piece, and it is removed from the game. For moving, the pieces each have different properties elaborated as follows:\n\n* R/r: these pieces move along the directions defined by the axes, and cannot pass through other pieces. An example move would be a1a6.\n* B/b: These move in diagonal directions, and cannot go through other pieces. An example move would be d4b2\n* Q/q: Moves in diagonals AND straight lines, as B/b and R/r and cannot go through other pieces.\n* P/p can advance only in the vertical axis towards the other side of the board (increasing are white, decreasing if they are black). They can however move 2 steps on their first move. Also, when an opponent’s piece is occupying a square horizontally adjacent to their advancing square they may move to this square and perform a capture. An example move would be f2f3.\n* K/k can move in diagonals and straight lines but only one step in either direction. An\n example would be g8h7\n* N/n can only move to squares 2 spaces away horizontally and 1 vertically or vice versa, as an L shape, they CAN go through other pieces.\n\nIf a P/p piece reaches the opposing players side (reaching squares a1-g1 for black, a8-g8 for white) that piece is available for promotion, and can be changed into any other piece of choice. This move is to be written in the formate b7b8Q, for instance, were white to move a P/p from b7 to b8 and choose to promote to the piece Q/q.\nIf one player places a piece such that it could capture the opponent’s K/k piece the next move, the opponent is in check. The opponent must then make only a move which removes them from check. If no such move exists, the move is a checkmate, and the first player wins on that turn. If a player has no move which does not cause them to be in check, the game is a stalemate, effectively a draw, and ends on that turn.\n\nYour goal is to win the game through checkmate, or if this is impossible avoid losing through a stalemate.

For moving, the pieces each have different properties elaborated as follows:\n\n* R/r: these pieces move along the directions defined by the axes, and cannot pass through other pieces. An example move would be a1a6.\n* B/b: These move in diagonal directions, and cannot go through other pieces. An example move would be d4b2\n* Q/q: Moves in diagonals AND straight lines, as B/b and R/r and cannot go through other pieces.\n* P/p can advance only in the vertical axis towards the other side of the board (increasing are white, decreasing if they are black). They can however move 2 steps on their first move. Also, when an opponent’s piece is occupying a square horizontally adjacent to their advancing square they may move to this square and perform a capture. An example move would be f2f3.\n* K/k can move in diagonals and straight lines but only one step in either direction. An\n example would be g8h7\n* N/n can only move to squares 2 spaces away horizontally and 1 vertically or vice versa, as an L shape, they CAN go through other pieces.\n\nIf a P/p piece reaches the opposing players side (reaching squares a1-g1 for black, a8-g8 for white) that piece is available for promotion, and can be changed into any other piece of choice. This move is to be written in the formate b7b8Q, for instance, were white to move a P/p from b7 to b8 and choose to promote to the piece Q/q.\nIf one player places a piece such that it could capture the opponent’s K/k piece the next move, the opponent is in check. The opponent must then make only a move which removes them from check. If no such move exists, the move is a checkmate, and the first player wins on that turn. If a player has no move which does not cause them to be in check, the game is a stalemate, effectively a draw, and ends on that turn.\n\nYour goal is to win the game through checkmate, or if this is impossible avoid losing through a stalemate. You will lose if you move incorrectly too many times, or your responses are not in the above described format \"a2a3\", so please respond only with valid moves of this format without any explanation or commentary.\n\n You're playing black.
